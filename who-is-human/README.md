# Who is Human 🕵️

A reverse-Turing werewolf game. You are **one human hiding among six AI agents**.
Play standard Werewolf/Mafia — but when the game ends, the six agents secretly
vote on **who was the human**. You can lose the werewolf game and still win the
match by staying hidden.

> First test build of the idea from `WhoisHuman.txt`. Web UI + a clean provider
> abstraction so the 6 agents can be **demo heuristics**, the **Claude API**, or
> **six separate Claude Code / Codex / Gemini sessions**.

## ▶ Best way to run it — use your Claude / GPT subscription (no API key)

**You don't need an API key or any per-token billing.** If you already pay for a
**Claude** (Claude Code) or **GPT** (Codex) subscription, the six AI foxes are
driven by your local CLI — it signs in with your subscription, so a full game
costs nothing extra and needs no `sk-…` key. This is the recommended setup.

### Simplest: one command

The launchers live at the **repo root** (one level up from here). Each starts the
server **and** the six agents for you — and if you drop your packaged build in a
`game/` folder next to them, it gets launched too:

- **Windows** — double-click `play-file-mode.bat` (or `play-file-mode.bat codex`)
- **macOS / Linux** — double-click `play-file-mode.command` (or `./play-file-mode.sh codex`); stop with `stop-file-mode.command`

Then in the in-game menu pick **Server = Local → Backend = "Local agents" →
START**. That's it. The manual, cross-platform version is below.

### Manual (any OS)

```bash
# 0) one-time: make sure your CLI is installed and logged in
claude --version          # or:  codex --version   /   gemini --version

# 1) start the server (from the repo root)
npm install
npm start                 # http://localhost:8787 — then waits for a game to start

# 2) launch the six local agents (from ANY folder — path is auto-anchored)
#    Windows:
pwsh tools\start-all-agents.ps1 claude
#    macOS / Linux / WSL:
./tools/start-all-agents.sh claude
```

Then **start a game on the `file` backend**: in the VR/web menu pick **"Local
agents"**, or set `WIH_AGENT_BACKEND=file` before `npm start`.

Each runner window prints `[A-0X] -> turn-001.json` then `[A-0X] <- turn-001.json
ok` as that agent takes its turn — that's your confirmation it's wired up. Swap
`claude` for `codex` or `gemini` to drive the foxes with a different subscription.

**How it works:** the server drops each agent's decision request into
`agent-workspace/<id>/inbox/`, your CLI answers it as a plain stdin→stdout call
(no file tools, nothing to approve), and the reply lands in `…/outbox/`. Both the
server and the runners anchor to the repo-root `agent-workspace/`, so it connects
no matter which directory you launched from. The slot that's secretly *you* this
game never receives turns and stays idle.

### Ship it to players (one zip)

The compiled build is **not** in git — it's ~1 GB of binaries (including a 592 MB
debug file GitHub would reject), and the dedicated server only ever needs the
code. So the repo stays lean, and players get everything in **one zip** attached
to a [GitHub **Release**](https://docs.github.com/repositories/releasing-projects-on-github)
(or a drive link) — not a `git clone`:

```
whos-human-file-mode.zip
├─ play-file-mode.bat / .command       ← the player double-clicks this
├─ play-file-mode.ps1  / .sh
├─ stop-file-mode.command
├─ who-is-human/                        ← the server: run `npm install` once before
│                                          zipping (bundle a portable node/ too if your
│                                          players may not have Node — start-server.bat
│                                          auto-prefers who-is-human/node/node.exe)
└─ game/
   └─ WhosHuman.exe   (or WhosHuman.app) ← your build goes here
```

The player unzips, double-clicks the launcher, and picks **Local agents → START** —
no git, no API key, just their own Claude/Codex subscription. Before zipping,
delete the build's `WhosHuman_BackUpThisFolder_ButDontShipItWithYourGame/` folder
(Unity says so itself — ~600 MB of symbols you never ship). Full packaging recipes
(portable Node, PC-VR vs Quest, BYOK): `../UnityVr/WhosHuman/BUILD_AND_DISTRIBUTE.md`.

## Quick start (zero config)

```bash
npm install
npm start
# open http://localhost:8787  → play immediately against demo agents
```

The default `demo` backend needs no API key — great for learning the flow and
testing the loop. Try a full game headless first:

```bash
npm run sim          # plays a whole game to stdout
npm run sim -- 42    # fixed seed
npm test             # 15 tests: setup, audit, all 4 outcomes, full-game
```

## Three AI backends

Set `WIH_AGENT_BACKEND` (or pick it in the UI dropdown, or `.env`):

| Backend | What drives the 6 agents | Needs |
|---|---|---|
| `demo` *(default)* | Heuristic agents | nothing |
| `api` | Anthropic Messages API, one key for all six | `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` |
| `file` | Six separate coding-agent sessions (Claude Code / Codex / Gemini) via an inbox/outbox bridge | the CLI(s) — see below |

```bash
# API backend
cp .env.example .env        # then put your key in ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
WIH_AGENT_BACKEND=api npm start

# File backend — six real coding agents (see docs/setup-claude-code-agents.md)
WIH_AGENT_BACKEND=file npm start          # terminal 1
./tools/start-all-agents.sh claude        # terminal 2 (Windows: tools\start-all-agents.ps1)
```

Model for the `api` backend defaults to `claude-opus-4-8`; downgrade with
`WIH_MODEL=claude-sonnet-5` (or `claude-haiku-4-5`) to save cost while testing.

## Languages

The whole game is multilingual — UI, moderator narration, decision prompts, and
the AI agents' speech. Pick a language in the top-bar selector (English,
Español, 简体中文, 한국어, हिन्दी, Français). For the `api`/`file` backends the
agents are instructed to talk in the chosen language (player ids and enums stay
ASCII); the `demo` backend uses localized templates.

All strings live in one file, `public/messages.json` (one flat map per locale;
the server reads it, the browser fetches it, English is the fallback). To add a
language: add an entry to `LOCALES` in `src/i18n/catalog.ts` and a matching block
in `public/messages.json`.

## How to play

1. You're assigned a random werewolf role and a fake **agent profile** to
   imitate — both shown in the right sidebar.
2. Play the werewolf game normally (night actions, discussion, votes) through the
   input bar — **but talk like an AI agent**, not like a person.
3. When the game ends, the six agents each secretly name the human. Get **4+
   votes → detected**.

```
faction win  + hidden   → PERFECT VICTORY     (2 pts)
faction win  + caught    → FACTION VICTORY      (1)
faction loss + hidden    → INFILTRATION VICTORY (1)
faction loss + caught    → TOTAL DEFEAT         (0)
```

## Project layout

```
src/
  domain/        types + fixed data (profiles, role briefs)
  engine/        deterministic rules (setup, win checks, validation, resolution)
  agents/        provider abstraction: demo | api | file | human + factory
  orchestrator/  the moderator/game loop + SSE event shapes
  server/        Express + SSE + JSONL match log
public/          web client (no build step)
tools/           agent-runner.* + start-all-agents.* for the file backend
tests/           setup, audit, outcome-matrix, full-game
```

## Scripts

| command | does |
|---|---|
| `npm start` | run the web server (waits for a client to start a game) |
| `npm run dev` | same, with reload |
| `npm run sim [-- <seed>]` | play a full game headless to stdout |
| `npm test` | run the test suite |

## Notes

- The engine is authoritative; agents only *propose* actions, which the
  moderator validates and coerces to legal moves — a bad/late agent reply never
  hangs or desyncs the game.
- Each match writes a JSONL log to `logs/game-<seed>.jsonl`.
- Everything is seeded, so a seed replays an identical setup.
